A <em><b>shepherd</em></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.<br>
<br>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted,"Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.<br>
<br>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <em><b>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</em></b><br>
<br>
After some days, while the sherpherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike><br>
